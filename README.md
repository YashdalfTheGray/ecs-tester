# ecs-tester
Integration testing with Puppeteer, Chromium headless, Jest and Docker!

## Setup

This project relies on Docker but can also be run outside of Docker. You will need Docker CE and/or a Node.js 8 or newer and npm v5 or newer to run this project.

The first thing to do is to create an IAM user with appropriate rights in your console so that the tests can log on as a user. Then create a file in this directory called `.env` and add four keys to it. The keys are listed below. The region follows the standard AWS region code format, eg. `us-east-1`.

```
AWS_ACCOUNT=<your_account_id_or_alias>
IAM_USERNAME=<your_iam_username>
IAM_PASSWORD=<your_iam_password>
REGION=<aws_region>
```

Once you have this created, you can either run `npm install` to install all the dependencies or run `docker build -t ecs-tester .` to build the image.

## Running the tests

To run the tests locally, follow the steps above and run `npm test`. This will run the Jest tests using Puppeteer and Chromium headless. Any screenshots will be in the `artifacts` folder.

To run the tests using Docker, run `docker run -it --name <some_name> --env-file .env ecs-tester`. Since the container is running in interactive mode, it will print the test results as they happen.

Once the tests are done running in docker, `docker inspect --format='{{.State.ExitCode}}' <name_set_in_run_command>` to check if they ran successfully. If successful, this should return `0`.

Screenshots are taken at the end of the tests if the `DEBUG` environment variable is set to `true`. The screenshots get saved in `./artifacts` while running locally and they get saved inside the container while running with Docker. To get started, run `docker diff <name_set_in_run_command>` and you'll see what screenshots were created.

You can access the screenshots by copying them out of the container and onto your host machine by running `docker cp <name_set_in_run_command>:/usr/app/artifacts <path_on_host>`. This will copy the entire folder of screenshots. 

## Puppeteer version
This project depends specifically on Puppeteer v0.13.0 because of a CSP issue with version 1.0.0 and newer. [This issue on the repository](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/issues/1229) and this [sandbox demo](https://puppeteersandbox.com/S0HVfA1j) has more information.

Until solved, we can't upgrade to the newer versions of Puppeteer. Until then, use the v0.13.0 docs link.

## Contributing

PRs are welcome! After making changes to the package, make sure that the tests are successful by running `npm test` and the linter is successful by running `npm run linter`.
