# Contributing to ecs-tester
I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it is

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Develop on Github
I use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
All code changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (I use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). I actively welcome pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`
1. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
1. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
1. Ensure the test suite passes
1. Make sure your code lints
1. Issue the pull request

## Contributions are licensed under MIT
Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License. In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Reporting bugs
I use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yashdalfthegray/ecs-tester/issues); it's that easy!

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
The code follows the [Airbnb's Javascript guidelines](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) with some changes that can be found in the `.eslintrc.json`.
